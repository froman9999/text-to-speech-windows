# Text to Speech (TTS) HTML GUI for Windows 11

## 🎁 Installation
1. Save [tts.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnat/text-to-speech-windows/refs/heads/main/tts.html) to your Desktop.
2. Drag it into your web browser.

Short and sweet, easy to audit HTML file!

Note: This pulls in the CDN version of [Surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal) and [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

## 💡 Why does this exist?
* Windows 11 removed the "Use the following text to preview the voice" feature. 🙁
* Security! `espeak-ng` is russian maintained now, so into the trash it goes.

## 🐧 A linux version would be nice!
