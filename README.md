# Text to Speech (TTS) HTML GUI for Windows 11

## üéÅ Installation
1. Download [tts.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnat/text-to-speech-windows/refs/heads/main/tts.html) to your Desktop.
2. Drag it into your web browser.

Short and sweet, easy to audit HTML file.

### Why?
* Microsoft. Windows 11 removed the "Use the following text to preview the voice" feature.
* Security. `espeak-ng` is russian maintained now, so into the trash it goes.

### A linux version would be nice!
